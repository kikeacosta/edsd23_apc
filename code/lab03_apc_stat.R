m_ap_lnr
m_ac_lnr
# what is the difference?
# exactly the same fitting, same deviance, same AIC...
# ... same model, different parameterization

# both are the same because the slope of change over time (P* or C* coefficient) 
# captures the **drift**, i.e., the sum of the true period and cohort slopes 
# (ùú∑_ùíë+ùú∑_ùíÑ).

# this is known as the **Age-drift model**

# the drift coefficient is in log scale; we have to transform it to obtain 
# the change of mortality over time

# how fast is changing mortality over time?
get_drift(m_ap_lnr)

# but age coefficients are different!
# because they are interpreted differently
# AdP: exp(coeffs) of age correspond to the death rates in the period of 
# reference (cross-sectional rates)
# AdC: exp(coeffs) of age correspond to the death rates in the cohort of 
# reference (longitudinal rates)

# this is called the Age-drift model


# how similar are the nonlinear models?
p_ac_nlr+p_ap_nlr
m_ap_nlr
m_ac_nlr
# the models are quite different
# these are the Age-Period and Age-Cohort models


# APC model ====
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# what happen if we just include everything?
s_apc <- glm(dts ~ factor(A) + factor(P) + factor(C), 
             offset = log(pop), family = poisson, data = dt2 )
s_apc

# it seems to be working... what is the issue with this?
# look at all the APC categories..., only the categories of references should 
# be lacking of coefficients

# why does the last cohort have a NA as coefficient?
# that is the way how R (other statistical software in general) treats 
# perfect multicollinearity: removes one variable for fitting the model
# this is equivalent of constraining both the first and last cohort categories 
# to be equal and zero

# the first dimension (period or cohort) added to the equation will absorb the 
# linear effect (drift), and the last one will be "detrended".  


# Holford approach 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Separate linear (drift) and nonlinear effects (APC), 
# both period and cohort effects will be "detrended" 
# the P and C reference are the first and last categories of each

# a few clues for manipulating the formula in the model
# the fitting will be the same but the interpretation of coeffcients will be
# more intuitive:
# adding a "-1" in the formula removes the intercept, and in this case, age 
# coefficients can be interpreted directly as rates.
# "I()" allows us to manipulate the formula, in this case to change the period 
# of reference in the liner trend (drift)
# "relevel()" allows us to change the category of reference for nonlinear effects
# it is possible to select the category by location or value
# relevel(factor(P), 10) | relevel(factor(P), "1950")

# Carstensen approach ====
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Separate linear (drift) and nonlinear effects (APC), 
# both period and cohort effects will be detrended, with sum/average = 0; 
# the reference is the linear trend;
# period and cohort curves are interpreted as the relative risks (RR)
# compared to the overall average / liner trend 

# advantages: 
# more flexibility in the modeling, allowing for 
# - semi-parametric terms (splines instead of factors)
# - different ways to extract the trend
# - better confidence intervals
# - better to interpret

# disadvantage: 
# - much more complex to model

# ... but the nice package "Epi" (made by Carstensen too) makes life much easier
